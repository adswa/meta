## Citing metadata

This repository contains the necessary metadata to cite me consistently.
With thanks to [Christopher J. Markiewicz](https://github.com/effigies/meta) for the idea and example implementation.

The mailmap file contains lines that, if added to your repository's [.mailmap](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap) file, will map any email address I've committed with.

The `zenodo.json` file contains a `person_or_org` object, defined in [https://zenodo.org/schemas/records/record-v1.0.0.json](https://zenodo.org/schemas/records/record-v1.0.0.json).
This object may be included as a contributor, creator, or similar field in a `.zenodo.json file.

In the zenodo.json file I use the form of my name I prefer for citations.

This data may be copied into your project without my express consent, although I may ask you to remove me from your project.
